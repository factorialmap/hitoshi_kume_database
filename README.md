## About Hitoshi Kume

Hitoshi Kume made exceptional contributions to the industrial development of post war in Japan since 1960 by training and guiding people from scores of industries in improving quality and reducing waste through effective utilisation of quality management concepts and techniques.

In 1989, he was awarded the Deming Prize for his outstanding contribution to the dissemination of quality control.

## Goals 
- Make data available to facilitate statistical practice, this data is in the Book **Statistical methods for quality improvement** by Hitoshi Kume published in 1987.
- Allow students to reproduce the experiments in the book using modern statistical tools, and continuing the work of educating people carried out by Dr. Kume during his life.

- **data_41_histogram.csv** : Histogram page 41
  > To investigate the distribution of the diameters of steel shafts produced in a grinding process, the diameters of 90 shafts are measured as show in this dataset. The idea is make a histogram using these data.

- **data_64_reactor.csv** : Histogram page 64
  > This dataset shows the yields from a certain chemical reaction process. Since two reaction vessels, A and B, were used for this reaction, it was pointed out that perhaps there was a difference between them. Stratification was carried out according to the reaction vessels. Differences we found between two reactions vessels.
  
- **data_66_baker.csv** : Histogram page 66
  > In a bakery, two bakers, A and B, are baking bread using two machines(machine1 and machine2). The weights of french loaves produced were recorded for 20 day as shown in this dataset. Four loaves were picked randomly from each machine every dar and were weighed. The weight specification is 200-225(g).
