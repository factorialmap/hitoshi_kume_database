## About Hitoshi Kume

Hitoshi Kume made exceptional contributions to the industrial development of post war in Japan since 1960 by training and guiding people from scores of industries in improving quality and reducing waste through effective utilisation of quality management concepts and techniques.

In 1989, he was awarded the Deming Prize for his outstanding contribution to the dissemination of quality control.

## Goals 
- Provide accessible data from "Statistical Methods for Quality Improvement" (Hitoshi Kume, 1987) to support hands-on statistical practice and learning.
- Empower students to replicate book experiments using modern statistical tools, while continuing Dr. Kume's legacy of education and outreach.

  > Effect in this case is **Defeat in a sports match**
  
- **data_34_cause_effect_dim_var.csv** : Cause-and-effect diagram page 34

  > All the shop members discussed the causes of the dimensional variation and constructed a cause-and-effect diagram. Effect in this case is **Dimensional variation**
    
- **data_41_histogram.csv** : Histogram page 41

  > To investigate the distribution of the diameters of steel shafts produced in a grinding process, the diameters of 90 shafts are measured as show in this dataset. The idea is make a histogram using these data.

- **data_64_reactor.csv** : Histogram page 64

  > This dataset shows the yields from a certain chemical reaction process. Since two reaction vessels, A and B, were used for this reaction, it was pointed out that perhaps there was a difference between them. Stratification was carried out according to the reaction vessels. Differences we found between two reactions vessels.
  
- **data_66_baker.csv** : Histogram page 66

  > In a bakery, two bakers, A and B, are baking bread using two machines(machine1 and machine2). The weights of french loaves produced were recorded for 20 day as shown in this dataset. Four loaves were picked randomly from each machine every dar and were weighed. The weight specification is 200-225(g).

- **data_70_scatter.csv** : Scatter plot page 70

  > Data to make a scatter plot

- **data_96_xbarr.csv** : Xbar-R control chart page 96

  > In this dataset 100 data was collected. For x-r chart divide them into 25 subgroups with 5 in each, making each of them uniform within the subgroup.

- **data_104_np.csv** : Np control chart page 104

  > A sample to classify the product quality into conforming and non-conforming units, according to the inspection standard. In this cases take a sample of such size that between 1 and 5 non-conforming units on the average are included within a subgroup, and gather 20 to 25 such subgroups.

- **data_117_tractor.csv** : Manufacturing leaf springs for tractors page 117

  > In a manufacturing leaf springs for tractors, cracks were found in some of the springs. It is necessary to identify the cause of the trouble as quickly as possible and to prevent it from occurring again. Let us use the data given in this dataset to construct histograms and control charts in order to analyze the problem.

- **data_140_machining.csv** : page 140

  > To investigate the manner of variation in a machining process of certain parts, dimensions of the parts were measured four times a day, at 09:00, 11:00, 14:00 and 16:00, as show in this dataset. Make an X-R chart to analyze this process.

- **data_183_t_paired.csv** : page 183

  > The lengths of 10 samples were measured before and after ultrasonic baking. Does the heat treatment cause a change in the length?

- **data_189_abrasion.csv** : page 189

  > An experiment was required to determine where or not a certain surface treatment increased the abrasion resistance of a particular type of material. Ten test-pieces of the material were taken; five of them were treated, and the others were left untreated. The abrasion resistance of the ten speciemens was then measured. The results are in this dataset.

- **data_cc_xbar_cnc_screw.csv** : extra content for control chart XBAR using CNC screw data

  > In an auto parts factory, the quality characteristic of interest is the primitive diameter machined from the thread made on a CNC machine. 25 samples were used with 5 measurements each of the diameter of the parts where the X-R chart will be used.

- **data_cc_imr_chemical.csv** : extra content for control chart IMR using Chemical process data

  > In the chemical industry, the quality characteristic of interest is the purity level, which must be above 85% according to the consumer's specifications. As it is done in batches that take time, we decided to do it using an IMR chart.

- **data_cc_np_shoes_mfg.csv** : extra content for control chart NP using Shoes manufacturing data

  > In a shoe factory, 100 pairs are analyzed daily. In the 25 working days of a month, the following number of defective pairs were obtained:

- **data_cc_p_batteries.csv** : extra content for control chart P using batteries manufacturing data

  > Data to make P control chart in battery manufacturing

- **data_cc_c_pcb.csv** : extra content for control chart C using PCB manufacturing process data

  > Number of defects observed in 26 successive samples of 100 printed circuit boards.

- **data_cc_u_computer.csv** : extra content for control chart U using computer manufacturing data

  > A manufacturer of microcomputers wants to establish a control chart for nonconformities per unit on the final assembly line. The sample size is chosen as 5 computers.

- **data_cc_u_fabric.csv** : extra content for control chart U using fabric manufacturing data
  
  > In a finishing factory dyed fabric is inspected for defects per 50 square meters.

- **data_cc_p_pen_mfg.csv** : extra content for control chart P using pen manufacturing data

  > Gift company received complaints from customers.
  > The opening mechanism does not work, the ink dries quickly, and the brand soon disappears. It is not possible to do a 100% inspection due to the low cost of the item, put the P chart at the end of the line

- **data_cc_p_fridge_mfg.csv** : extra content for control chart P using Refrigerator manufacturing data
  
  > Refrigerator factories have a series of faults such as scratches on the paint, doors that don't close properly, broken feet, the refrigerator doesn't turn on, etc.

- **data_cc_xr_animal_food.csv** : extra content for control chart XR using animal food process manufacturing data

  > A feed factory wants to measure the weight variation between bags, for this purpose 6 subgroups with 5 measurements each were used.
