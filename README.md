## About Hitoshi Kume

Hitoshi Kume made exceptional contributions to the industrial development of post war Japan since 1960 by training and guiding people from scores of industries in improving quality and reducing waste through effective utilisation of quality management concepts and techniques.

In 1989, he was awarded the Deming Prize for his outstanding contribution to the dissemination of quality control.

## Goals of this folder
- The purpose of this folder is to store the data contained in the book **Statistical methods for quality improvement** by Hitoshi Kume published in 1987.
- The idea is to make the data available for those who are interested in reproducing the experiments and exercises using current scientific tools, continuing the work of educating people carried out by Dr. Kume during his life.

## File name, usage and book page
- **data_pareto_20.csv** : Pareto chart page 20
    
- **data_histogram_41.csv** : Histogram page 41
  > To investigate the distribution of the diameters of steel shafts produced in a grinding process, the diameters of 90 shafts are measured as show in this dataset. The idea is make a histogram using these data.

- **data_reactor_64.csv** : Histogram page 64
  > This dataset shows the yields from a certain chemical reaction process. Since two reaction vessels, A and B, were used for this reaction, it was pointed out that perhaps there was a difference between them. Stratification was carried out according to the reaction vessels. Differences we found between two reactions vessels.

- **data_baker_66.csv** : Histogram page 66
  > In a bakery, two bakers, A and B, are baking bread using two machines(machine1 and machine2). The weights of french loaves produced were recorded for 20 day as shown in this dataset. Four loaves were picked randomly from each machine every dar and were weighed. The weight specification is 200-225(g).

- **data_xbarr_96.csv** : Xbar-R control chart page 96
  > In this dataset 100 data was collected. For x-r chart divide them into 25 subgroups with 5 in each, making each of them uniform within the subgroup.
  > 

- **data_np_104.csv** : Np control chart page 104
  > A sample to classify the product quality into conforming and non-conforming units, according to the inspection standard. In this cases take a sample of such size that between 1 and 5 non-conforming units on the average are included within a subgroup, and gather 20 to 25 such subgroups.
